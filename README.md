# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains various machine learning projects and implementations, covering fundamental algorithms and techniques in machine learning.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several directories, each containing a specific machine learning project:

- `Classification-with-Logistic-Regression/`: Implementation of logistic regression for classification tasks
- `K-Means Clustering/`: Implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm
- `KNN classifier/`: Implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm
- `data-preprocessing-task/`: Data preprocessing techniques and implementations
- `decisiontrees_randomforests/`: Decision Trees and Random Forests implementations
- `exploratory-data-analysis/`: Exploratory data analysis projects
- `linear-regression/`: Implementation of linear regression
- `support vector machines/`: Implementation of Support Vector Machines
-  `Image classification using CIFARID Dataset/`: Implentation of simple image clssification using ANN

## Prerequisites
