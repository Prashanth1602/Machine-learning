# 🧠 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This project performs exploratory data analysis on a dataset to understand the underlying patterns, distributions, relationships, and key statistical insights.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Generate summary statistics
- Visualize distributions using histograms and boxplots
- Explore feature relationships using correlation matrices and pairplots
- Derive basic inferences to guide future modeling

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly (optional for interactive visualizations)

---

## 📊 Key Visualizations

- Histograms: To understand the distribution of numeric features
- Boxplots: To detect outliers and spread
- Correlation Matrix: To identify relationships between features
- Pairplot: For multivariate pattern discovery
