# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Decision Trees and Random Forests

This project demonstrates the use of **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** classifiers to predict the presence of heart disease based on various health metrics.

---

## 📁 Dataset

We use the [Heart Disease UCI dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ronitf/heart-disease-uci), which includes various medical attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, etc.

---

## 📌 Objectives

1. Train and visualize a **Decision Tree** classifier.
2. Analyze **overfitting** and control tree depth using `max_depth`.
3. Train a **Random Forest** classifier and compare performance.
4. Interpret **feature importances** using bar plots.
5. Evaluate the model using **cross-validation**.
